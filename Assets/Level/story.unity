  m_Text: "Alarms blare at a local asylum. One of the most dangerous and clinically
    insane patients Salis has escaped. In the year before his admittance, he sacrificed
    over 50 civilians to his god, the god of torment and destruction as he called
    it. Salis believes that his god needs more power which was slowly dwindling while
    he was trapped at the asylum and that he has by the end of the day to feed his
    god the last sacrifices or he would be teleported to the altar and sacrificed
    himself. These thoughts gave him the strength and cunning to escape \u201Cimprisonment\u201D.
    Now Salis is on the streets and ready to pick up where he left off. He doesn\u2019t
    have much time left and he needs to make sure he\u2019s not captured again.\r\n\nSalis
    was just like any other guy, working to make ends meet and support his family
    until his wife got sick. He was up to his neck in medical bills and could barely
    pay the rent at the end of the month. The doctors said that she didn\u2019t have
    long. His wife only had 2 month to live and told him to get everything in order
    to prepare for her passing. Salis was mortified, he always had hope but now that
    was slipping away. But one day when he was walking home from the hospital he heard
    whispers. He couldn\u2019t quite make them out until they started yelling his
    name. \u201CSALIS\u201D! He fell to the ground in pain. When the yelling stopped
    he looked up to find himself in a shroud of darkness. \r\n\nThat\u2019s when he
    met the Ishtar the Goddess of torment. The Goddess told Silas that he could heal
    his wife but it would cost him. Salis still a little in shock hesitates but as
    he looks upon the goddess he begins to picture the look on his wife\u2019s face
    as she lay in the hospital fighting for her life. This gives him the strength
    to make the deal no matter the consequences. Ishtar tells Salis that she will
    only heal his wife if he can agree on the terms. The 1st term is that he serves
    the God for eternity as his demon, and the second term is that Salis has two months
    to deliver her 200 sacrifices but if he shall fail to meet the second term then
    his life will be forfeit to the goddess and his wife will die. Salis knew that
    this was his only shot so he made a verbal contract with Ishtar and in that instant
    the shroud of darkness disappeared.\r\nSalis was back on the streets but now he
    felt different. He felt a bloodlust that he had never know before. He felt stronger
    and more focused. Salis did not waste another moment. He wanted to kill and he
    wanted to save his wife. The killings started to change him. His face started
    to look more disturbing after each sacrifice so he put a paper bag that he found
    over his head. He stopped eating, stopped sleeping, Salis turned into a being
    who only knew murder. He started to turn mad with the only thing keeping the voices
    from whispering to him to complete the sacrifices was to think about his wife
    and when that wouldn\u2019t silent them he just continued to kill. After a month
    of sacrificing person after person the cops finally caught and arrested him. Everyone
    in the police station was terrified when he walked in. His aura was dark and made
    it hard for them to breathe. \r\n\nDays before his trial, he started to feel the
    pain and the voices. He never went days without killing. The voices started to
    flow out and he started to murmur and whisper about Ishtar and the sacrifices
    nonstop. Even when he was in court he would talk as if no one was there, the voices
    deafened him and blinded his focus. They sent him to a high security Asylum. Ishtar
    saw what happened to her greatest creation yet but being maniacal she thought
    it would be fun to let him rot until the last day since he was only a month in
    and had sacrificed 195 people. She couldn\u2019t let him complete the sacrifices
    so easily. \r\n\nThree weeks into being held at the Asylum Salis stopped his talk
    and became quiet. The voices in his head could feel time running out and began
    to work as one with Silas. They told him that Ishtar would open his room on the
    last day so he should train his body nonstop until he is let out."
